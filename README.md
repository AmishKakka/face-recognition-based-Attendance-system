# face-recognition-based-Attendance-system

There are various files and images which constitute this project.

First, the.jpeg files are nothing but icon images required for buttons in the interface.

The Attendance_window file takes attendance of only registered people in real time and creates a csv file which records the time and date of the entry.

The Registration file allows people to register which is done by adding the details in a database file.

This are the main functionalities. Other functionality like deleting a record and admin login have also been added.
